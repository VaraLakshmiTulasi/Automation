*Conditional&Control_Statements*: '
      Here we will implement the logic->Describe the execution flow of the program.

*Types*:
a.If_Else
b.Nested_If_Else
c.While
d.do_While
e.for
f.Continue
g.break
h.Switch_case

*If_else* :
     When ever we execute set of statements based on condition will used if_else condition.
 *Syntax* :
        if(<condition>)
        {
            //statements
        } 
        else
        {
            //statements
        }   

*Note* :
a.10/2=5(dividend)
b.10%2=0(Remainder) , %->Modular Operator
c.i=j ->Assigning
d.i==j ->Comparision of two operators

*Nested_If_Else* :
      When ever we execute multiple conditions executed at one time we will used nested_if_else condition.
 *Syntax* :
    if(<condition>)
        {
            //statements
        } 
        else if
        {
            //statements
        } 
       else if(<condition>)
        {
            //statements
        } 
        else
        {
            //statements
        }    

 *While*:
    Here we will execute set of statements need to execute repetedly based on condition.
 *Syntax*:
     while(<condition>)
     {
        //statements
     } 
*Note*:
When ever used while loop First it will checking the condition then it will execute the statements.

*do_while*:
     Here do_while is also same as while loop but it will execute statement after that it will checking the condition.
*Syntax*:
do
{
    //statements
}while(<condition>);

*Note*:
"=="-> equality comparision between the two primitive types.(int/char/double/boolean etc)
"!=" -> Not equality comparision between primitive types.
"equals()" -> Used to compare whether two strings are equal or not.

*for*:
     Here we want to declare/fixe number of iterations to be executed.
 *Syntax*:
       for(Initialvalue;condition;increment/decrement) 
       {
        //statements
       }   
  *Note*:
  a.i++->i=i+1           d.i-- -> i=i-1
  b.i+=1->i=i+1          e.i-=1 ->i=i-1 
  c.i+=2->i=i+2          f.i-=2 ->i=i-2

  *Continue*;
        If you want to skip the current iteration&continue withe the next iteration or To skip the current loop and goto the next loop.

  *break*:
       We used break statement to terminate the loop or we don't want iteration &comeout off the loop.
